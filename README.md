# Silicate
A library providing powerful client-server-agnostic predicates with a simple API.

## Goal
The goal of Silicate is to complete a context-aware predicate system on par with Minecraft's Loot Context-aware predicates. Available for Fabric and NeoForge, Silicate provides a common API for interfacing advanced predicates between mods, across platforms. Silicate achieves this by implementing a clean-slate predicate architecture, initially independent of Minecraft.

## Features
Silicate provides out-of-the-box Codec and datapack support, enabling developers and modpack designers to more easily implement desired functions. Silicate also comes with built-in predicates for Minecraft's various game interactions, easing the amount of boilerplate necessary.
